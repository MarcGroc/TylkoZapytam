### Context and Problem Statement
- Our team is building a new software application that will need to expose a RESTful API to allow clients to interact with the application. We are considering several different options for building the API, including hand-rolling our own solution and using a framework such as Django Rest Framework (DRF).


### Decision:
- We have decided to use Django Rest Framework (DRF) to build the API for our software application.
- 
### Reasons for the decision:

- DRF is built on top of the popular Django web framework, which means it integrates seamlessly with other Django components and is well-suited for building web-based applications.

- DRF includes a wide range of features and tools that make it easy to build, test, and deploy a RESTful API, including support for serialization, authentication, and documentation.

- DRF has a large and active community of users and developers, which means that there is a wealth of resources and support available for those using the framework.

- DRF has a proven track record of success in building APIs for a wide range of applications, which gives us confidence that it will be a reliable and effective solution for our needs.

### Consequences:

Using DRF to build the API for our application will require us to familiarize ourselves with the framework and to design our API in a way that is consistent with DRF's conventions and best practices. We will also need to ensure that we have the necessary dependencies and libraries installed to use DRF. However, we believe that the benefits of using DRF, including the time and effort it will save us in building the API, will outweigh the additional effort required to learn and use the framework.
