### Date:

### Status:
- Accepted

### Context and Problem Statement
- Our team is building a new software application that will need to be hosted in the cloud. We are considering several different options for a cloud provider, including Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform.


### Decision:
- We have decided to use Amazon Web Services (AWS) as the cloud provider for our software application.
### Reasons for the decision:
- AWS is the largest and most mature cloud provider, with a wide range of services and features that can meet the needs of most applications.

- AWS has a strong track record of reliability and uptime, which is critical for our application.

- AWS offers a wide range of pricing options, including pay-as-you-go and reserved instances, which gives us flexibility in how we pay for the resources we use.

- AWS has a large and active community of users and developers, which means that there is a wealth of resources and support available for those using the platform.

### Consequences:
 Using AWS as our cloud provider will require us to familiarize ourselves with the platform and to design our application to make use of AWS services. We will also need to ensure that we have the necessary credentials and permissions to use AWS. However, we believe that the benefits of using AWS, including the extensive feature set and strong track record of reliability, will outweigh the additional effort required to learn and use the platform.
